# wave-tattoo-studio-wordpress-site

During my internship at **Nexora Solutions** as a **Front-End and Junior Backend Developer**, I developed a fully functional **e-commerce website** for selling **tattoo-related items** using **WordPress**.

I was primarily responsible for the **UI/UX design**, layout structuring, theme customization, and ensuring responsive performance across all devices. The site includes product listings, category filters, custom post types, and a smooth shopping experience tailored to the target audience.

In addition to front-end development, I also worked on **backend tasks**, including configuring plugins, managing product databases, setting up custom fields, and handling user data through the WordPress dashboard. I ensured the site was optimized for performance and could be easily updated by non-technical users.

While the **payment gateway** was not integrated, I built all other essential e-commerce functionalities, such as product pages, cart structure, and order flow. I collaborated with the senior development team to ensure seamless functionality and a professional finish.

This project strengthened my skills in **WordPress**, **PHP**, **HTML/CSS**, and **basic backend development**, and gave me real-world experience working on a client-focused commercial website from design to deployment.
